The difference is that delta sets contain only the face maps, whereas simplicial sets also contain degeneracy maps. The main effect of the degeneracy maps is to enlarge the space of simplicial morphisms by allowing simplices to be \"collapsed\" onto lower-dimensional ones. Degeneracy maps have their pros and cons, and in the future we will likely provide simplicial sets as well as semi-simplicial ones. For more details, the paper by Greg Friedman is an excellent illustrated introduction to semi-simplicial and simplicial sets.","category":"page"},{"location":"simplicial_sets/","page":"Simplicial sets","title":"Simplicial sets","text":"Simplicial sets generalize graphs from one dimension to higher dimensions.
