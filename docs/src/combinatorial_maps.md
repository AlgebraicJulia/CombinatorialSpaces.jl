# Combinatorial maps

CombinatorialSpaces has incomplete, experimental support for several
combinatorial structures used in topological graph theory, such as
[combinatorial maps](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/combinatorial+map) and
[rotation systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_system). For an
introduction to rotation systems and their implementation, see this [blog
post](https://www.algebraicjulia.org/blog/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-2/) at the
AlgebraicJulia blog.
